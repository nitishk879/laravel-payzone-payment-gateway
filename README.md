# laravel-payzone-payment-gateway

I'm developing a Payzone [Take Payments] payment gateway for my e-commerce website with laravel 6 and 7. 
This is just initial stage of development of this package. 
You also can share your view or can contribute to make it more appropriate. I'm not sure how all this work correctly. 
I've added Controller, Model, Event, Mail and Notifications to this. I'm trying to fix all this as composer package.

This package is still incomplete, due to my busy schedule, but, I'm trying to complete it asap.

You can install this package
`composer require svodya/payzone`

Version `1.0.2`

Please publish vendor first. 
You need to publish *config*, *public*, *migrations* etc. 
`php artisan vendor:publish`
