# laravel-payzone-payment-gateway

I'm developing a Payzone [Take Payments] payment gateway for my ecommorce website with laravel 7+. This is just initial stage of development of this package. 
You also can share your view or can develop it a little bit more. I'm not sure how all this work correctly. I'm new to the laravel.
